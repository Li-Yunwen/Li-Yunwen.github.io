{% include base_path %}

This is a course project for Programming for Robotics at CUHK-SZ. The delivery robot detects AR tags which encodes orientation information for reaching the next target, and plans a path towards. I used
- gmapping to pre-build a map of the environment;
- AR tag detection to get the orientation to see the next tag;
- move_base to find path to goals in the room.
