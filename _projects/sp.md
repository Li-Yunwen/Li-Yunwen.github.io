This is my Semester Project during my master's study at ETHZ. It was conducted at [Multi-Scale Robotics Lab](https://msrl.ethz.ch/the-lab/team.html) led by Prof. Bradley Nelson. My supervisors are Claas Ehmke and Jasan Zughaibi.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness, treated through precise, repeated intravitreal injections. This project enhances a robotic platform designed to automate these injections. Key improvements include camera calibration and kinematic optimization. 
- AprilTags were used to calibrate the relative transformation between each component.
- An optimization algorithm was developed to refine the robotâ€™s kinematic parameters.
- Needle calibration was also performed to refine the kinematic parameters of the end-effector. 
- The system successfully guided needles into 0.5mm targets. 
- The limitation lies in the localization accuracy of Apriltags.
- The project was graded 5.75/6.
